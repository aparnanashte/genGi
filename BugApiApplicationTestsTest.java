```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class BugApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`@SpringBootTest`**: This annotation indicates that the class is a Spring Boot test. It sets up the Spring application context for testing.
* **`@Test`**: This annotation marks the `contextLoads` method as a JUnit test method.
* **`contextLoads()`**: This method simply checks if the application context loads successfully. It's a basic test to ensure the application starts up without errors.

**To run the test:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test dependencies in your project.
2. Right-click on the test class in your IDE and select "Run".

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a very basic test case. You can add more specific tests to cover various aspects of your application.
* You can use other Spring Boot Test annotations like `@WebMvcTest` or `@DataJpaTest` for more specific testing needs.
* For more complex tests, you might need to mock dependencies or use integration tests.
