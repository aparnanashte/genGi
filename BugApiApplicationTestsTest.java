```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class BugApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`@SpringBootTest`**: This annotation indicates that this is a Spring Boot test class. It will start a Spring application context for testing.
* **`@Test`**: This annotation marks the `contextLoads()` method as a JUnit test method.
* **`contextLoads()`**: This method is a simple test that verifies that the Spring context can be loaded successfully. It doesn't perform any specific assertions, but it's a good starting point for writing more comprehensive tests.

**How to Run the Test:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test dependencies in your project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
2. Run the test class using your IDE's test runner or by running the command `mvn test` (for Maven) or `gradle test` (for Gradle).

**To create more comprehensive tests:**

* Add assertions to your test methods to check expected behavior.
* Use mock objects to isolate and test specific components.
* Define test data to ensure your application functions correctly with various inputs.
* Consider testing different endpoints of your API using tools like `RestTemplate` or `MockMvc`.

This is a very basic example, but you can expand upon it to test different aspects of your `BugApiApplication`. Remember to focus on testing critical functionalities and edge cases to ensure your application is robust and reliable.
