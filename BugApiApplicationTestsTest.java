```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
public class BugApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`@SpringBootTest`:** This annotation indicates that this class is a Spring Boot test. It sets up the Spring context, making all the application beans available for testing.
- **`@Test`:** This annotation marks the `contextLoads()` method as a test method.
- **`contextLoads()`:** This method simply checks that the Spring context loads successfully. It doesn't perform any specific assertions, as its main purpose is to ensure that the application starts up without errors.

**To run the test:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 installed.
2. Right-click on the test class in your IDE and select "Run" (or equivalent).

This test case is a basic example and serves as a starting point. You can add more specific tests to validate different aspects of your application.

**To expand the test cases, consider testing the following:**

- **Controller methods:** Test the API endpoints by sending requests and validating the responses. You can use tools like `MockMvc` to achieve this.
- **Service methods:** Test the logic of your services by mocking dependencies and asserting the expected outcomes.
- **Repositories:** Test your data access layer by creating and retrieving data from the database.
- **Database interactions:** Test that your application interacts with the database correctly.

Remember to adjust the test methods and assertions to suit the specific needs of your application.
