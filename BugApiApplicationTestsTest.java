```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
public class BugApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;`**: Imports the `Test` annotation from JUnit 5 for marking test methods.
* **`import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;`**: Imports the `SpringBootTest` annotation from Spring Boot, which loads the application context for testing.
* **`@SpringBootTest`**:  This annotation tells Spring Boot to create a test context that loads the application context. This allows you to test your application's functionality.
* **`public class BugApiApplicationTests {`**: Defines the test class named `BugApiApplicationTests`.
* **`@Test`**:  Marks the `contextLoads()` method as a test method.
* **`void contextLoads()`**:  This is a simple placeholder method that does nothing. You can add your actual test methods here to verify different aspects of your application.

**To run these tests:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test dependencies in your project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
2. Right-click on the test class in your IDE and select "Run" or "Debug". 

This will run the test and provide you with results in the test console. You can expand on this basic structure by adding more test methods that specifically target different components and functionality within your `BugApi` application.
