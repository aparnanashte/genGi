```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
public class BugApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;`:** Imports the `Test` annotation from JUnit 5 for marking methods as test methods.
* **`import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;`:** Imports the `SpringBootTest` annotation from Spring Boot Test for creating a Spring Boot application context for testing.
* **`@SpringBootTest`:** This annotation tells Spring Boot to start the application context for testing.
* **`public class BugApiApplicationTests {`:** The test class is named `BugApiApplicationTests`.
* **`@Test`:** This annotation marks the `contextLoads()` method as a test method.
* **`void contextLoads() { }`:**  This is a simple test method that does nothing. It's a placeholder that ensures the application context starts up without errors. 

**To run these tests:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test dependencies in your project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
2. Run the tests using your IDE's testing framework or by running the command `mvn test` from your project's root directory.

**Note:** This is a basic test class. You'll need to add more specific test methods to cover your application's functionality thoroughly.
