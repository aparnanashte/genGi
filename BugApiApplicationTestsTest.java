```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class BugApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Import statement:** `import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;` imports the `Test` annotation from JUnit 5, which marks a method as a test case.
* **Import statement:** `import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;` imports the `SpringBootTest` annotation from Spring Boot, which indicates that this is a Spring Boot test and will start the application context.
* **Class declaration:** `class BugApiApplicationTests { ... }` defines the test class. The class name should be descriptive and reflect the purpose of the test.
* **`@SpringBootTest` annotation:** This annotation marks the class as a Spring Boot test, automatically creating an application context for testing.
* **`@Test` annotation:** This annotation marks the `contextLoads` method as a test case.
* **`contextLoads()` method:** This method is a simple test that asserts that the application context is successfully loaded. It doesn't perform any specific functionality testing.

**To run this test:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test dependencies added to your project.
2. Right-click on the test class and choose "Run 'BugApiApplicationTests'.".

**Note:**

This is a basic example of a JUnit test case. For real-world testing, you'll need to write more specific tests that cover different functionalities and scenarios of your application.
