```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
public class BugApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`@SpringBootTest`**: This annotation tells JUnit to start a Spring Boot application context for the test.
* **`contextLoads()`**: This test method checks that the application context can be loaded successfully. It doesn't assert anything, but it's a basic sanity check to ensure your application starts up correctly.

**How to run the test:**

1. **Make sure you have JUnit and Spring Test dependencies in your project's pom.xml or build.gradle file.**
2. **Run the test class.** You can do this using your IDE's test runner or from the command line.

**Additional considerations:**

* **Add more tests:** You'll want to add more specific tests to cover your application's functionality. This might involve testing individual controllers, services, repositories, or other components.
* **Use mock objects:** If your code depends on external services or databases, you can use mock objects to isolate your tests. This ensures your tests run quickly and consistently, without relying on external systems.
* **Use assertions:** Make sure your tests include assertions that check the expected behavior of your code. Use methods like `assertTrue()`, `assertEquals()`, or `assertNull()` to validate the results.
