```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

@SpringBootTest
class BugkApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Import statements:**
    * `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`: Imports the `Test` annotation to mark methods as test methods.
    * `org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest`: Imports the `SpringBootTest` annotation to indicate that the class is a Spring Boot test.
    * `static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*`: Imports static assertion methods from JUnit Jupiter.

* **`BugkApiApplicationTests` class:**
    * Annotated with `@SpringBootTest`, which tells Spring Boot to create a test context for the application.
    * Contains a single test method `contextLoads()`.

* **`contextLoads()` method:**
    * Annotated with `@Test`, indicating that this is a test method.
    * Contains a single assertion `assertTrue(true);`. This is a trivial assertion that will always pass, and is included here to demonstrate the basic structure of a JUnit test method.

**To run this test case:**

1. Ensure you have JUnit Jupiter and Spring Boot Test dependencies in your project.
2. Run the `BugkApiApplicationTests` class using your IDE's testing framework or from the command line.

**Additional Notes:**

* This test case is very basic and only checks that the application context is loaded correctly.
* To test specific functionality, you will need to add more test methods and assertions.
* Consider using mock objects and other testing techniques to isolate and test specific components of your application.
* Refer to the Spring Boot documentation for more information on testing Spring Boot applications: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/testing.html
