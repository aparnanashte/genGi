```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNotNull;

@SpringBootTest
public class BugkApiApplicationTest {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
        // This test simply ensures that the application context loads successfully.
        assertNotNull(BugkApiApplication.class);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import statements:**
    - `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`: Import the `Test` annotation from JUnit 5 to mark methods as test methods.
    - `org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest`: Import the `SpringBootTest` annotation to indicate a Spring Boot application context should be created for testing.
    - `static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNotNull`: Import the `assertNotNull` assertion method from JUnit 5 to verify that the application context is not null.

2. **`BugkApiApplicationTest` class:**
    - The class is annotated with `@SpringBootTest`, which tells Spring Boot to create an application context for testing.

3. **`contextLoads()` method:**
    - This method is annotated with `@Test`, making it a test method.
    - It calls `assertNotNull(BugkApiApplication.class)` to verify that the application context is created and the `BugkApiApplication` class is loaded successfully.

**Running the tests:**

To run the test, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
mvn test
```

This will execute all the tests in the project, including the `BugkApiApplicationTest` class.

**Important notes:**

- This is a basic test case that only checks if the application context loads successfully. You can add more specific tests to validate different aspects of your application, such as controller functionality, service logic, and database interactions.
- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies for testing in your `pom.xml` file.
- The `BugkApiApplication` class should be your main application class with the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.
