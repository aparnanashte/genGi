```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
public class BugkApiApplicationTest {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`@SpringBootTest`**: This annotation indicates that the test class should be used to test a Spring Boot application.
* **`contextLoads()`**: This is an empty test method that simply checks if the application context can be loaded successfully.

**To run the test case:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit and Spring Test dependencies in your project.
2. Right-click on the test class and select "Run 'BugkApiApplicationTest' ".
3. The test should run and pass if the application context is successfully loaded.

**Note:**

This is a basic test case that only checks if the application context can be loaded. You can add more test cases to test specific functionalities of your application.
