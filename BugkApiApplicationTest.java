```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNotNull;

@SpringBootTest
public class BugkApiApplicationTest {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
        BugkApiApplication application = new BugkApiApplication();
        assertNotNull(application);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`@SpringBootTest`**: This annotation indicates that this class is a Spring Boot test and will start the application context.
* **`contextLoads()`**: This is a test method that checks if the application context is loaded successfully.
* **`assertNotNull(application)`**: This assertion checks if the `BugkApiApplication` object is not null, which implies that the application context has been loaded correctly.

**To run the test:**

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test dependencies in your project.
2. Execute the test class from your IDE or using a command-line tool like Maven.

**Note:** This is a basic test case that only verifies the application context loading. You can add more tests to cover specific functionalities or components of your application.
